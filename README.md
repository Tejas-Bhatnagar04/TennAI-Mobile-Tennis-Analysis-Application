# TennAI-Mobile-Tennis-Analysis-Application
A mobile tennis analysis application developed as part of my Master's dissertation at Trinity College Dublin

This project attempts to track the tennis ball and produce a placement report. The solution uses a single camera to track the activites on the near side of the court. The project serves as a proof of concept for a 2-camera solution, placed at either ends of the court, to track the gameplay and produce a statistical report of the same. 

Requirements: Python 3.12.3 and OpenCV 4.10.0.
